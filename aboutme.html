<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Deja Tyla Jackson. I am a junior at Kennesaw State University majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in 
   pursuing a career in the information security. I found my admiration for Computers in high school in my first computer related course entitled
   Math, Technology & Society. In this course I learned about the ancient societies, such as the Mayans and how they computed and built
   stuctures. In addition, I learned about old cypehring and decryption methods.</p>
   <p>A few years following, I enrolled in AP Computer Science. AP CS was absolutely amazing, I learned all about Java and ASCII and how 
   I basicially had control of my entire computer through the click of a few buttons. Since then, I have taught myself a lot to stay up to date with technology
   and recent discoveries. My latest feat, as of last week has been to familiarize myself with command line and linux. </p>
   
<p>A few fun facts about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I love skating!</li>
  <li>I love adventures!</li>
  <li>I love strolling through the park on a nice fall day!</li>
</ul>
