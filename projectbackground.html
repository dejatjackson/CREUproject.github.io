<h1>Project Background</h1>
<h1>Project Title: Analyzing the Potential of Learning Reading and Math Skills 
Through Computational Thinking</h1>
<p>Students: Deja Tyla Jackson, Erica Pantoja, Cindi Simmons and Kate Zelaya</p>
<p>Faculty Advisors: Dr. Amber Wagner and Dr. Melissa Driver</p>   
<p>For this project I am working alongside a team of Computer Science majors to develop a block programming language in Blockly
  using HTML and JavaScript to teach elementary students with disabilities programming while enhancing math and reading skills. 
  At this point, my group has completed the basic research stage, developed a rubric and designed the basic block functionality.
  Currently, we are in the means of building the language and preparing for our upcoming concert in March of this year. </p>
