<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the 2016-17 CREU Project. For more details
  regarding my project please visit the Project Background section.</p>
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week of August 21 to 27, I began to familziatize myself with a variety of block languages, one of which
  included Scratch. I have used it before a while back in early middle school and remember how oddly fun it was to learn through
  the simple tool. Additionally, I began compling a list of materials to read in the future concerning education and block 
  languages. Lastly, I have made my Github account, but haven't completely set it up the neccessary features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week of August 28 to September 3, I countinued to learn and become familiar with block languages. In addition, I finalized
   the main content of this blog. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding
   for this project and its neccesary demands.</p>
<h2>Week of Sept 4-10</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 4 to 10, I have organized a gooogle drive in whcih I will begin to poppulate with items I research 
   and find. I also have begun to play around with Blockly, the language we have decided we will work with for this project. In addition, 
   I plan to finish up a article I have been reading regarding education and block languages.</p>
