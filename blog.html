<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the project. 
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week fo August 21 to 27, I began to familziatize myself with a variety of block languages, one of which
  included Scratch. I have used it before a while back in early middle school and remember how oddly fun it was to learn through
  the simple tool. Additionally, I began reading about how to teach children to "think like coders". Lastly, I have made my Github account,
  but haven't completely set it up the neccessary features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week fo August 21 to 27, I countinued to learn and become familiar with block languages. In addition, I finalized
   the main content of this blog. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding
   for this project and its neccesary demands.</p>
