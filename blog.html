<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the 2016-17 CREU Project. For more details
  regarding my project please visit the Project Background section.</p>
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week of August 21th to 27th, I began to familiarize myself with a variety of block languages, 
  one of which included Scratch. I have had prior experience with this language before in earl middle school. 
  The language was interesting and fun to learn back then. With my experience level today, it was both oddly fun and 
  simple to build elaborate designs. Additionally this week, I began compiling a list of materials to read in the future 
  concerning education and block languages. Lastly, I made my Github account, but haven't completely set it up the necessary
  features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week of August 28th to September 3th, I continued to learn and become familiar with block languages. 
   In addition, I finalized the main content of this blog in order for it to appear physically appealing and represent my 
   research group. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding for this
   project and its necessary demands. I believe I have a strong enough background on the basics of block languages to 
   continue research and get more in depth. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 4-10</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 4th to 10th, I have organized a Google drive in which I will begin to populate with items 
   I research and find of importance to this project. I also have begun to learn how to use Blockly, the language my group and
   I have decided we will work with for this project. In addition, I plan to finish up a article I have been reading regarding
   education and block languages. The information I have learning has been really interested, and I am excited to share this 
   information with my research partners. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 11-17</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 11th to 17th, I’ve been reading an article concerning how to effectively evaluate software
   for educational purposes. This article has been eye-opening in a sense, because I didn’t realize how important and intense 
   evaluations should be. I also didn’t realize that there were so many learning styles and methods of relaying the same 
   information to get across to different types of learners and people. Another article I have read this week went hand in
   hand with the first one and talked about the impact of creativity on learning. From the article, I concluded creativity 
   is one of the most important aspects of learning, and my team definitely needs to include this in our software. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 18-24</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 18th to 24th, I’ve been reading articles about how to build with blockly and use the software. 
   I was also able to play and learned from various open-source Blockly projects on Code.org. This week I played the game
   Star Wars: Building a galaxy with Code and Minecraft: Hour of Code. The Minecraft game was the better of the two as it allowed
   for feedback, gave the option to show the user the code they created, had prompts in the corner to remind the user of the 
   question at hand and was fun. The criteria it listed was a lot of the same criteria I learned was important for teaching software
   in the article I read last week. These games were both fun and useful and definitely helped me get a better understanding of the use and manipulation of this tool.</p>
<h2>Week of Sept 25-Oct 1</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 25th to Oct 1st, I have been brainstorming criteria in which to critique the block language 
     we are going to create. Additionally, I have been working on the abstract we will submit for an upcoming presentation.
     I also have been working to create two story line ideas of us to use our block language for. My first idea is the “First Day
     of School” and my second ideas is “A Random Day in summer”. Of course, I am still brainstorming so the names and lines are 
     subject to change. This week has been very fun for me as I have really been able to get into the real details of the project
     and begin to see my results. I am excited for the weeks to come. </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 2-8</h2>
   <p>During the week of Oct 2nd to Oct 8th, I have been working with my group to finalize the abstract I originally created last week.
     In addition, I am reading and commenting on the story lines the other members of my group have created, as well as obtaining some
     feedback on mine. I also have had the chance to begin creating and finding research that helps support the rubric for our blocky
     language. This rubric is what we will use to build our language and ensure that we are meeting the necessary guidelines for a 
     successful language. </p>
