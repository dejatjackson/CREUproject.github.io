<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the 2016-17 CREU Project. For more details
  regarding my project please visit the Project Background section.</p>
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week of August 21th to 27th, I began to familiarize myself with a variety of block languages, 
  one of which included Scratch. I have had prior experience with this language before in earl middle school. 
  The language was interesting and fun to learn back then. With my experience level today, it was both oddly fun and 
  simple to build elaborate designs. Additionally this week, I began compiling a list of materials to read in the future 
  concerning education and block languages. Lastly, I made my Github account, but haven't completely set it up the necessary
  features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week of August 28th to September 3th, I continued to learn and become familiar with block languages. 
   In addition, I finalized the main content of this blog in order for it to appear physically appealing and represent my 
   research group. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding for this
   project and its necessary demands. I believe I have a strong enough background on the basics of block languages to 
   continue research and get more in depth. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 4-10</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 4th to 10th, I have organized a Google drive in which I will begin to populate with items 
   I research and find of importance to this project. I also have begun to learn how to use Blockly, the language my group and
   I have decided we will work with for this project. In addition, I plan to finish up a article I have been reading regarding
   education and block languages. The information I have learning has been really interested, and I am excited to share this 
   information with my research partners. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 11-17</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 11th to 17th, I’ve been reading an article concerning how to effectively evaluate software
   for educational purposes. This article has been eye-opening in a sense, because I didn’t realize how important and intense 
   evaluations should be. I also didn’t realize that there were so many learning styles and methods of relaying the same 
   information to get across to different types of learners and people. Another article I have read this week went hand in
   hand with the first one and talked about the impact of creativity on learning. From the article, I concluded creativity 
   is one of the most important aspects of learning, and my team definitely needs to include this in our software. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 18-24</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 18th to 24th, I’ve been reading articles about how to build with blockly and use the software. 
   I was also able to play and learned from various open-source Blockly projects on Code.org. This week I played the game
   Star Wars: Building a galaxy with Code and Minecraft: Hour of Code. The Minecraft game was the better of the two as it allowed
   for feedback, gave the option to show the user the code they created, had prompts in the corner to remind the user of the 
   question at hand and was fun. The criteria it listed was a lot of the same criteria I learned was important for teaching software
   in the article I read last week. These games were both fun and useful and definitely helped me get a better understanding of the use and manipulation of this tool.</p>
<h2>Week of Sept 25-Oct 1</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 25th to Oct 1st, I have been brainstorming criteria in which to critique the block language 
     we are going to create. Additionally, I have been working on the abstract we will submit for an upcoming presentation.
     I also have been working to create two story line ideas of us to use our block language for. My first idea is the “First Day
     of School” and my second ideas is “A Random Day in summer”. Of course, I am still brainstorming so the names and lines are 
     subject to change. This week has been very fun for me as I have really been able to get into the real details of the project
     and begin to see my results. I am excited for the weeks to come. </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 2-8</h2>
   <p>During the week of Oct 2nd to Oct 8th, I have been working with my group to finalize the abstract I originally created last week.
     In addition, I am reading and commenting on the story lines the other members of my group have created, as well as obtaining some
     feedback on mine. I also have had the chance to begin creating and finding research that helps support the rubric for our blocky
     language. This rubric is what we will use to build our language and ensure that we are meeting the necessary guidelines for a 
     successful language. </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 9-15</h2>
   <p>During the week of Oct 9 to Oct 15th, I have been working on the rubric we will be using in order to grade our language and 
     ensure we are meeting the goals we have set upon ourselves to accomplish with this language. The most important aspects our
     language are that is needs to provide the user with feedback and as well as have a clear goal and purpose. Additionally, I
     have been working on a poster proposal that my group will use in order to submit to present at an upcoming SIGSE Conference. 
     I have never written a poster proposal before, so this experience has been both challenging and interesting.
     In a way, I must sell my research and make other people see why it is so important and that they must take interest in it.  
          </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 16-22</h2>
     <p>During the week of Oct 16th to Oct 22th, I have been familiarizing myself with the blocky documentation.
       There is a lot to understand and familiarize myself with, so this may take a few weeks to completely grasp before 
       beginning to build the language. In addition, I have been finalizing the proposal my group and I have drafted for the 
       SIGSE Conference. I also have been working on possible commands and elements I would like for us to include in our block
       language.
          </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 23-29</h2>
        <p>During the week of Oct 23rd to 29th, I have continued to familiarize myself with the blocky documentation.
          I am trying to understand the measures I need to take to be successful in building this program language. 
          Some of the important concepts include how to build blocks, and how to integrate some of the features I would like
          to include in the language. In addition, I have been brainstorming some possible ideas and ways to implement items 
          into the language. So far, my group and I have made significant progress in researching and understanding what we 
          need to do. We now need to move into the phase of the project that includes actually building the language. 
          </p>
 <h2>Week of Oct 30- Nov 3</h2>       
         <p>During the week of Oct 30 to November 5th, I have been extremely busy with school and planning for events on campus.
           Meanwhile, for the project I have been working to really understand blockly. Blockly seems very user friendly if you can 
           really tune in and understand what you are looking at and working with. Else, everything seems complex in confusing. Our 
           group has decided on a storyline to focus on this week: a grocery store scenario. I plan to begin building the code for 
           the clock and the graphic I choose very soon, until then I am working to understand exactly how one may build these code 
           and familiarizing myself with similar project code.  
          </p>
 <h2> Week of Nov 6-12th</h2>
           <p>During the week of November 6th  to 12th, my team has preparing for a conference. Unfortunately, due to an
             orientation for an internship that I cannot reschedule, I am unable to attend the conference alongside them.
             Meanwhile, I am still working with blocky and focusing in our grocery store scenario. I am having some difficulty,
             as I have be unable to give my undivided attention, but this weekend I plan on sitting down and spending a lot of 
             time familiarizing myself with this code more. So far, I really have learned a lot and I am really looking forward
             to implementing this project and seeing the results transform into reality. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of Nov 13-19th</h2>
          <p>During the week of November 13th to 19th, I haven’t heard back from my groupmates on how the conference went. 
            Meanwhile, school has been very hectic prior to Thanksgiving Break, and therefore, I haven’t had the best opportunity
            to work on the Block Language. Therefore, I will use my break to do more work. Some of the work I have done is look at 
            other block languages and their code to get familiar with them. At the meeting this week, I am hoping to hear back from 
            my group and learn about their successes and problems they encountered. I have had experience presenting before, but I am 
            aware that many of those in my group have not. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of November 20-26th</h2>
          <p>During the week of November 20th to 26th, I have been on Thanksgiving Break from my university.  As a result, I haven’t 
            engaged in a lot of work this week. In the work I have completed, I had a meeting with my group on Monday in which we 
            discussed upcoming due dates and the success of the conference. I am currently working on creating a poster for us to
            present at the KSU College of Computing’s C-day on December 1st. I am excited about this presentation and the ability
            to tell faculty and students at the university about the work I have been doing this semester. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of November 27th-December 3rd</h2>
          <p>During the week of November 27th to December 3rd, I have completed the poster of my group to present at C-day. 
            We presented our research at the conference and I believe it went very well. The experience was great as it allows for
            one of our group members to practice her presentation skills before an official conference. We obtained a lot of questions a
            nd interests from people that stopped by to listen. My group and I meet in person this week and discussed upcoming concerns, 
            necessities and plans for the winter break. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of Decemeber 4th-10th</h2>
           <p>During the week of December 4th to 10th, I was taking finals for my classes to wrap up the semester. After meeting with my 
             group I have a better understanding of what is required of me over the winter break. This week, I have finished programming
             the block for our storyline and will begin to implement and work on its functionality soon. I will use some of the samples 
             and examples that Dr. Wagner has provided us to do this. This semester has been very rewarding and I have very much enjoyed
             the research thus far. Now that we have gotten through the initial phase, I am looking forward to having a functioning language
             very soon. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of Decemeber 11th-17th</h2>  
          <p>During the week of December 11th-17th, I have begun to work with two programming languages. At the last meeting, we assigned
            every group member two programming languages to review and find key terms. We then will use these terms and analyze them ensuring
            that kids in our designed age group will understand those terms. We will use these terms to help better dictate our own programming language.
          </p>
<h2> Week of Decemeber 18th-24th</h2>
            <p>During the week of December 18th-24th, I have continued to look into the two programming language in which I have been assigned.
              In addition, I have also been working with creating functionality. This has provided itself difficult because the examples I have
              come across haven’t been very similar to what I am trying to achieve myself. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of Decemeber 25th-31st</h2>
           <p>During the week of December 25th-31st, I did not do any work related to research as I was out of town celebrating the holiday
             with my family. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of January 1st to 7th</h2>
          <p>During the week of December 4th to 10th, I have begun to plan for the upcoming semester. I have coordinated with my group times 
            for us to meet next semester. In addition, I have looked over the things I have done this winter break in order to effectively 
            represent them and prepare to explain my progress thus far. Our goal for the next few weeks is to accumulate some deliverables to 
            send to the College of Education. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of January 8th to 14th</h2>
          <p>Work Accomplished:
            During the week of January 8th-14th, I made some adjustments to my blog and updated information such as my resume and some of the 
            blog contents. In addition, I reviewed the words I found in Minecraft and Scratch. I saw that most of these words were very simple 
            and I believed that elementary students could comprehend these words. Some words included the words transparency, extension, and 
            spawned. I think these keywords will be very helpful for my group in determining which words we will use in our own block 
            language.</p>
            <p> Goal:
            Our goal for the next few weeks is to prepare for the upcoming conference and send off our review of key terms to the College of 
            Education. </p>
             <p>Lesson's Learned:
            I have learned that the words we are to use in our language are very important, because the language will be unsuccessful 
            if they aren’t interrupted as we expect. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of January 15th to 21st</h2>
          <p>Work Accomplished:
            During the week of January 15th-21st, I met with the other members of my group on Tuesday morning from 9am to 11am. As a team, 
            we problem solved and tried to figure out some of the code for the graphics of the project. We had worked on it during the break, 
            but we needed some time to talk through the problems were encountered together. I was not able to find a solution to my problems; 
            hopefully, I will be able to reach a solution during the meeting next week with the entire team and our advisor. </p>
           <p> Goal:
            Our goal for the next few weeks is to prepare for the upcoming conference and send off our review of key terms to the College of 
             Education.  </p>
            <p>Lessons learned:
            I learned that in coding this kind of project there are numerous ways to implement a solution, and you need to not necessarily do the easiest 
            one, but the one that is the easiest for you. When you work from your strengths you get the best results.  
          </p>
<h2>Week of January 22nd to 28th</h2>
           <p>Work Accomplished:
             During the week of January 22nd – 28th, I made travel arrangements with others in my group in order to plan for the SIGSE conference
             my group is going to present in March 2017. I registered for the SIGSE conference in March and also assisted in other arrangements 
             such as flights and hotel. My group members and I also completed the IRB Training. In addition, I began to complete the IRB Application
             for my research group.</p>
            <p> Goal:
             Our goal for the next few weeks is to be coordinated and prepared for the upcoming conference. This entails
             making sure we have all been registered, updating the poster and working on the language.</p>
             <p>Lesson's Learned:
             So far, I have learned that planning a 
             conference is very stressful, but hopefully it will all be worthwhile. In addition, I learned the importance of IRB training when 
             working with younger students. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of January 28th to Febuary 4th</h2>
         <p>Work Accomplished:
           During the week of January 29th-Feb 4th, I have been working to complete the IRB Application. In addition, I drew the design I will implement in order to
           complete my graphics. I have begun to work with Photoshop and prepare these graphics. I am also working with compensation for the upcoming conference. </p>
         <p> Goal:
           Our goal for the next few weeks is to be coordinated and prepared for the upcoming conference. 
           This includes programming and preparing our student survey.</p>
         <p>Lesson's Learned:
           So far, I learned the importance of both IRB training when working with younger students and how to implement such training. 
           We did be doing so with a student activity. </p>
<h2>Week of Feb 5th to Febuary 11th</h2>
         <p>Work Accomplished:
           During the week of February 5th – 11th, I have been in contact with my group to ensure we are all working to be prepared for this conference. 
           I have completed my graphics and waiting for my group to review them to ensure they are up to par. Having completed IRB training, 
           we are looking to see how to move forward in the process.  In addition, I have begun working on my lit review paragraphs that will 
           reference literary sources and link them to aspects of the rubric.  </p>
         <p> Goal:
          Our goal for the next few weeks has remained the same. We are still coordinating and preparing for the upcoming conference.
           This includes programming and preparing our student survey.</p>
         <p>Lesson's Learned:
           This week, I have re-learned how to use Photoshop after a few years. Additionally, I have looked over some of the work of my 
           groupmates to learn how we are going to work directly with students. The activity one of my team members created was interesting and seems very efficient.   </p>   
<h2>Week of Feb 12th to Febuary 18th</h2>
         <p>Work Accomplished:
          The week of February 12th – 18th has been very busy and it is Midterms week at the University. 
           During this week however, I have been finalizing my travels forms for the upcoming conference. I have sent in my literature 
           review and I am waiting to hear back from my advisor about the quality before I proceed. I started to evaluate the rubric 
           against Scratch. I am evaluating the language against the rubric we designed to see if they have the qualities we are 
           looking for. We can use our results to guide us in designing our own.  </p>
         <p> Goal:
          We are still moving towards our goal of being prepared for the upcoming conference in Seattle, Washington. </p>
         <p>Lesson's Learned:
           This week, I have learned how to evaluate a programming language. As a student, I have always been graded with a rubric,
           but being on the other side and grading with a rubric myself is a different experience.   </p>  
<h2> Week of Feb 19th to Febuary 25th</h2>
          <p>Work Accomplished:
           During the week of February 19th – 25th, I have been finalizing my literature review for my potion of the rubric.
           In addition, I have been brainstorming ideas for the poster for the upcoming conference. We should like to include 
           more information about the evaluations of rubrics as well as what our language should look like as well. I also have 
           been evaluating Minecraft against the rubric we have created, as I did last week with Scracth. 
          </p>
          <p>Goal:
           My team is still moving towards our goal of being prepared for the upcoming conference and doing all the necessary things
           to be properly prepared.
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I was able to play around with more of the Hour of Code programs and learn the strengths and weaknesses of the 
            varying languages. Many of them were very helpful and included manners that assisted the user in walking through the language
            effectively. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of Feb 26th to March 4th</h2>  
          <p>Work Accomplished:During the week of February 26th to March 4th, I have been programming the features of the block language.
            In order to do this, I have been working with the blockly library in Github Desktop and implementing some of the code features.
            I am mainly working on the design aspect.  In addition, I looked over the poster and ensured it was suit for presentation.
            I made some suggestions that I hope will be implemented in the final project.
          </p>
           <p>Goal:
            With one week before our presentation at the conference, our goal this week has been to finalize preparations for 
           the project. We will be flying out to Seattle on March 8th. 
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
           This week, I have been able to code and put to use elements we have researched and study. It has been difficult to teach 
            myself, but rewarding at the same time. I can’t wait for my team and I to work towards a finished product. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of March 5th to March 11th</h2>
          <p>Work Accomplished: During the week of March 5th – March 11th, my research group and I ensured that we had every finalized 
            and printed for our attendance at the conference this week. We will be flying out March 8, 2017 and returning on March 11th. 
            Although, we are missing a lot of school, attending this conference has been our goal for a while and we plan to be very 
            successful. 
          </p>
          <p>Goal:
            Our goal this week has been to be successful at this conference and network and get to know people. This conference also gives 
            us the opportunity to learn about the research being completed by other students and professors.
          </p>
          
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have been able to add and continue to learn the value of reaching out of your comfort zone to continue to get to
            know people and network. I am looking forward to attending more conferences in the near future. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of March 12th to March 18th </h2>     
          <p>Work Accomplished:During the week of March 12th to March 18th, I have been working to develop 2 ideas we can use to guide the 
            story. After the group votes on a particular idea, I will work to fully develop that story using some things I have learned from 
            Software Engineering. At the conference, we got a lot of feedback on the project and many people are hoping to see a final product. 
            e are planning to apply for an extension so we will have time to make modifications. I wrote up the student section for this report.
            To make up for some of the sessions I wasn’t able to attend at the conference, I have been reading some research papers of sessions
            that seemed interesting. Some of these sessions include, “Cybersecurity for Future Presidents” and “Capture the Flag Unplugged”. 
          </p>
          <p>Goal:
            Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to make progress towards building the language. This includes developing the storyline, 
            finishing the graphics and working to program the block functionality and game space.
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have learned the use of applying knowledge from the classroom to real-world applications such as this project.
          </p>
<h2>Week of March 19th to March 25th </h2>     
           <p>Work Accomplished:During the week of March 19th – 25th, I have completed by complete breakdown of the story line and sent 
             it to my group. I have given them a brief explanation and answer any questions they’ve had in regards to my work. I analyzed 
             Pixly, an example our professor permitted us to reference. Pixly has similar elements but is not entirely like our language 
             at all. It was useful to analyze the code section by section to try to get a better understand of the roles different elements
             played. I have contacted my advisor in hopes that she can contact the person she knows who is more familiar with how to work 
             interrupters. I will continue to understand how they work and build the language.</p>
          <p>Goal:
            Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to make progress towards building the language. This includes developing the storyline, 
            finishing the graphics and working to program the block functionality and game space.</p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have continued to build by skills and knowledge on applying skills from the classroom to real-world applications 
            such as this project.</p>

<h2>Week of March 26th to April 1st </h2>  
          <p>Work Accomplished: During the week of March 26th – April 1st , I have continued to build on the language and learn how to integrate and work 
            with blocky. This had included looking into how the storyline will work together and coding these blocks and pieces.
          </p>
          <p>Goal:
            Our goal in the upcoming weeks is still to make progress towards building the language. This includes developing the storyline, 
            finishing the graphics and working to program the block functionality and game space.
          </p>
          <p> Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have continued to build by skills and knowledge on applying skills from the classroom to real-world 
            applications such as this project.
          </p>
  <h2>Week of April 2nd to April 8th </h2>  
          <p>During the week of April 2nd to April 8th, I do not have a report. I will be on Spring Break vacation on a Cruise to Mexico without internet or cell service.  
            I will continue to pursue my research project when I return. 
          </p>
   <h2>Week of April 9th to April 15th </h2>  
           <p>Work Accomplished:During the week of April 9th- April 15th, I have continued to build the programming language. This has been difficult but a learning 
             experience. We have luckily been granted a summer extension, so I am hoping to talk with my advisor and discuss a timeline from now until the completion of the project. 
          </p>
          <p>Goal: Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to have a good foundation to complete the project on time. 
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned: 
            This week, I have continued to struggle and work with the language. One IT person once told me you don’t really know something until it breaks and you
            have to learn how to fix it. This is very true in the life of a programmer. 
          </p>
    <h2>Week of April 16th to April 22nd </h2>  
           <p>Work Accomplished:During the week of April 16th- April 22nd, I have ensured that in the storyline I have written for our language, it is properly broken down. 
             This stricture will ensure that the language is simple and easily understood by the other members of my team so they can complete
             their assignments. They are in charge of ensuring we have a list of all the blocks we need to make as well as all the graphics that
             need to be created 
          </p>
          <p>Goal: Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to continue to establish a good 
            foundation to end the semester to begin our summer extension.
          </p>
          <p>This week, I haven’t really learned anything new in the way of the project. I just continued to build my expertise on concepts I already understand
                 or have a working knowledge of from my prior blogs.
                 
         </p>         
 <h2>Week of April 23rd to April 29th</h2>
          <p>Work Accomplished: During the week of April 30th to May 6th, I have helped my team develop the final report to submit regarding the progress of
            our project thus far. This week was finals week so I have very busy focusing on those as well.</p>
         <p>Goal: Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to continue to establish a good 
            foundation to end the semester to begin our summer extension.
          </p>
          <p>This week I have been able to reflect on the entirety of this project. As a research group, we have really came a long way, 
            but we still have some work to continue to build.  
   <h2>Week of April 30th to May 6th </h2>        
          <p>Work Accomplished: During the week of April 30th to May 6th, I have helped my team develop the more technical final report to submit regarding the progress of our project thus far. My sections 
            to assist on were the related work and the future work sections. This week was finals week so I have very busy focusing on those as 
            well.
          </p>
          <p>Goal:Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to establish a great foundation to continue development of the language. 
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have been able to continue to develop my technical writing skills which was exemplified 
            in helping with the final report.
          </p>
   <h2>Week of May 7th to 13th </h2>     
          p>Work Accomplished:During the week of May 7th to May 13th, I have finished the website search. I was waiting for one of the websites to email me back with more information in regards to 
          whether they supported the type of website that we needed. I also have begun to build more blocks based on my original storyline that Cindi has added more blocks too to support
          the focus of my story.
          </p>
          <p>Goal:Our goal in the upcoming weeks is to establish a great foundation to continue development of the language. 
          </p>
          <p>Lesson's Learned:
            This week, I have continued to learn how to successfully work with Blockly.
