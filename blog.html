<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the 2016-17 CREU Project. For more details
  regarding my project please visit the Project Background section.</p>
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week of August 21th to 27th, I began to familiarize myself with a variety of block languages, 
  one of which included Scratch. I have had prior experience with this language before in earl middle school. 
  The language was interesting and fun to learn back then. With my experience level today, it was both oddly fun and 
  simple to build elaborate designs. Additionally this week, I began compiling a list of materials to read in the future 
  concerning education and block languages. Lastly, I made my Github account, but haven't completely set it up the necessary
  features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week of August 28th to September 3th, I continued to learn and become familiar with block languages. 
   In addition, I finalized the main content of this blog in order for it to appear physically appealing and represent my 
   research group. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding for this
   project and its necessary demands. I believe I have a strong enough background on the basics of block languages to 
   continue research and get more in depth. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 4-10</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 4th to 10th, I have organized a Google drive in which I will begin to populate with items 
   I research and find of importance to this project. I also have begun to learn how to use Blockly, the language my group and
   I have decided we will work with for this project. In addition, I plan to finish up a article I have been reading regarding
   education and block languages. The information I have learning has been really interested, and I am excited to share this 
   information with my research partners. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 11-17</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 11th to 17th, I’ve been reading an article concerning how to effectively evaluate software
   for educational purposes. This article has been eye-opening in a sense, because I didn’t realize how important and intense 
   evaluations should be. I also didn’t realize that there were so many learning styles and methods of relaying the same 
   information to get across to different types of learners and people. Another article I have read this week went hand in
   hand with the first one and talked about the impact of creativity on learning. From the article, I concluded creativity 
   is one of the most important aspects of learning, and my team definitely needs to include this in our software. </p>
