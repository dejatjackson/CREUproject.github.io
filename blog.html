<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
  <p>In this section I will post weekly updates in regards to my progress and particpation in the 2016-17 CREU Project. For more details
  regarding my project please visit the Project Background section.</p>
<h2>Week of August 21-27</h2>
  <p>During the week of August 21th to 27th, I began to familiarize myself with a variety of block languages, 
  one of which included Scratch. I have had prior experience with this language before in earl middle school. 
  The language was interesting and fun to learn back then. With my experience level today, it was both oddly fun and 
  simple to build elaborate designs. Additionally this week, I began compiling a list of materials to read in the future 
  concerning education and block languages. Lastly, I made my Github account, but haven't completely set it up the necessary
  features yet.</p>
<h2>Week of August 28-Sept 3</h2>
   <p>During the week of August 28th to September 3th, I continued to learn and become familiar with block languages. 
   In addition, I finalized the main content of this blog in order for it to appear physically appealing and represent my 
   research group. Through reading articles and playing around with block languages I have acquired a better understanding for this
   project and its necessary demands. I believe I have a strong enough background on the basics of block languages to 
   continue research and get more in depth. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 4-10</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 4th to 10th, I have organized a Google drive in which I will begin to populate with items 
   I research and find of importance to this project. I also have begun to learn how to use Blockly, the language my group and
   I have decided we will work with for this project. In addition, I plan to finish up a article I have been reading regarding
   education and block languages. The information I have learning has been really interested, and I am excited to share this 
   information with my research partners. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 11-17</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 11th to 17th, I’ve been reading an article concerning how to effectively evaluate software
   for educational purposes. This article has been eye-opening in a sense, because I didn’t realize how important and intense 
   evaluations should be. I also didn’t realize that there were so many learning styles and methods of relaying the same 
   information to get across to different types of learners and people. Another article I have read this week went hand in
   hand with the first one and talked about the impact of creativity on learning. From the article, I concluded creativity 
   is one of the most important aspects of learning, and my team definitely needs to include this in our software. </p>
<h2>Week of Sept 18-24</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 18th to 24th, I’ve been reading articles about how to build with blockly and use the software. 
   I was also able to play and learned from various open-source Blockly projects on Code.org. This week I played the game
   Star Wars: Building a galaxy with Code and Minecraft: Hour of Code. The Minecraft game was the better of the two as it allowed
   for feedback, gave the option to show the user the code they created, had prompts in the corner to remind the user of the 
   question at hand and was fun. The criteria it listed was a lot of the same criteria I learned was important for teaching software
   in the article I read last week. These games were both fun and useful and definitely helped me get a better understanding of the use and manipulation of this tool.</p>
<h2>Week of Sept 25-Oct 1</h2>
   <p>During the week of September 25th to Oct 1st, I have been brainstorming criteria in which to critique the block language 
     we are going to create. Additionally, I have been working on the abstract we will submit for an upcoming presentation.
     I also have been working to create two story line ideas of us to use our block language for. My first idea is the “First Day
     of School” and my second ideas is “A Random Day in summer”. Of course, I am still brainstorming so the names and lines are 
     subject to change. This week has been very fun for me as I have really been able to get into the real details of the project
     and begin to see my results. I am excited for the weeks to come. </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 2-8</h2>
   <p>During the week of Oct 2nd to Oct 8th, I have been working with my group to finalize the abstract I originally created last week.
     In addition, I am reading and commenting on the story lines the other members of my group have created, as well as obtaining some
     feedback on mine. I also have had the chance to begin creating and finding research that helps support the rubric for our blocky
     language. This rubric is what we will use to build our language and ensure that we are meeting the necessary guidelines for a 
     successful language. </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 9-15</h2>
   <p>During the week of Oct 9 to Oct 15th, I have been working on the rubric we will be using in order to grade our language and 
     ensure we are meeting the goals we have set upon ourselves to accomplish with this language. The most important aspects our
     language are that is needs to provide the user with feedback and as well as have a clear goal and purpose. Additionally, I
     have been working on a poster proposal that my group will use in order to submit to present at an upcoming SIGSE Conference. 
     I have never written a poster proposal before, so this experience has been both challenging and interesting.
     In a way, I must sell my research and make other people see why it is so important and that they must take interest in it.  
          </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 16-22</h2>
     <p>During the week of Oct 16th to Oct 22th, I have been familiarizing myself with the blocky documentation.
       There is a lot to understand and familiarize myself with, so this may take a few weeks to completely grasp before 
       beginning to build the language. In addition, I have been finalizing the proposal my group and I have drafted for the 
       SIGSE Conference. I also have been working on possible commands and elements I would like for us to include in our block
       language.
          </p>
<h2>Week of Oct 23-29</h2>
        <p>During the week of Oct 23rd to 29th, I have continued to familiarize myself with the blocky documentation.
          I am trying to understand the measures I need to take to be successful in building this program language. 
          Some of the important concepts include how to build blocks, and how to integrate some of the features I would like
          to include in the language. In addition, I have been brainstorming some possible ideas and ways to implement items 
          into the language. So far, my group and I have made significant progress in researching and understanding what we 
          need to do. We now need to move into the phase of the project that includes actually building the language. 
          </p>
 <h2>Week of Oct 30- Nov 3</h2>       
         <p>During the week of Oct 30 to November 5th, I have been extremely busy with school and planning for events on campus.
           Meanwhile, for the project I have been working to really understand blockly. Blockly seems very user friendly if you can 
           really tune in and understand what you are looking at and working with. Else, everything seems complex in confusing. Our 
           group has decided on a storyline to focus on this week: a grocery store scenario. I plan to begin building the code for 
           the clock and the graphic I choose very soon, until then I am working to understand exactly how one may build these code 
           and familiarizing myself with similar project code.  
          </p>
 <h2> Week of Nov 6-12th</h2>
           <p>During the week of November 6th  to 12th, my team has preparing for a conference. Unfortunately, due to an
             orientation for an internship that I cannot reschedule, I am unable to attend the conference alongside them.
             Meanwhile, I am still working with blocky and focusing in our grocery store scenario. I am having some difficulty,
             as I have be unable to give my undivided attention, but this weekend I plan on sitting down and spending a lot of 
             time familiarizing myself with this code more. So far, I really have learned a lot and I am really looking forward
             to implementing this project and seeing the results transform into reality. 
          </p>
<h2>Week of Nov 13-19th</h2>
          <p>During the week of November 13th to 19th, I haven’t heard back from my groupmates on how the conference went. 
            Meanwhile, school has been very hectic prior to Thanksgiving Break, and therefore, I haven’t had the best opportunity
            to work on the Block Language. Therefore, I will use my break to do more work. Some of the work I have done is look at 
            other block languages and their code to get familiar with them. At the meeting this week, I am hoping to hear back from 
            my group and learn about their successes and problems they encountered. I have had experience presenting before, but I am 
            aware that many of those in my group have not. 
          </p>
<h2> Week of November 20-26th</h2>
          <p>During the week of November 20th to 26th, I have been on Thanksgiving Break from my university.  As a result, I haven’t 
            engaged in a lot of work this week. In the work I have completed, I had a meeting with my group on Monday in which we 
            discussed upcoming due dates and the success of the conference. I am currently working on creating a poster for us to
            present at the KSY College of Computing’s C-day on December 1st. I am excited about this presentation and the ability
            to tell faculty and students at the university about the work I have been doing this semester.
